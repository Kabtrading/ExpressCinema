# ExpressCinema

A server-side rendering example using node, ejs, express, and request

In this example application we use express with asynchronous requests to TMBD API and recieve
the current most popular movies.
There is also a search field where you can search for specific movies, get multiple results back,
then make a selection to get a few simple details about the film.
